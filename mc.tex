\chapter{Monte Carlo event generation}
\label{ch:mc}

% need simulation to compare experimental measurements, i.e. event counts, to predictions
% probabilistic - many parts untractable (hadronization, detector response, etc), huge phase space
% MC simulation: always good-ish convergence even with large phase space
% can be computationally expensive
% chain of simulation tools: ME - parton shower - hadronization & decay, MPI - pileup - detector & trigger simulation

\section{Monte Carlo method}

\section{Matrix Element generators}

% generate hard scattering
% ME element, phase space factors
% convolution with PDF, factorization theorem of QCD
% higher orders in QCD: real + virtual corrections
% renormalization & factorization scales: chosen heuristically, represent missing knowledge (of non-pert. / higher orders respectively)

\section{Parton showers and matching}
\label{sec:mc:showering}

% problem: radiation of gluons in QCD
% coupling constant is large - happens often
% confinement - free gluons and quarks are not physical, need to hadronize
% but hadronization happens at low scales: Lambda_QCD
% idea: start with hard scattering, evolve down to hadronization scale by radiating gluons off quarks & splitting gluons into gg or qq 
% probability of splitting at a certain scale given by matrix elements - perturbative in principle!
% but: collinear & infrared singularities

% for NLO ME: already emission in ME
% needs to be matched to shower to not double count
% details depend on the exact algorithms of ME generator and shower
