\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}

% begin : purpose of HEP - understand fundamental secrets of nature
% want to find new physics - but where to look
% promising: the top quark. heaviest SM particle - large Yukawa coupling to Higgs, new Higgs sectors, bare quark
% top quark colored, heavy, unstable - challenging to model in SM
% understanding top quark crucial for sm & bsm
% this thesis: study different aspects of ttbar production
% done as part of CMS, LHC, yadda yadda

% Run 3 of LHC: startup after shutdown, different calibrations etc
% new COM energy, energy frontier
% Run 3 ttbar xs measurement: first result of run 3
% validate data after shutdown

% study on off-shell ttbar / tttW interference modeling
% bb4l: full off-shell matrix element
% validated in CMS, compared to other generators
% input for future ttbar precision measurements

% search for new states in ttbar spectrum, Run 2, full lumi
% BSM: heavy higgs bosons
% top quark decays before hadronizing: access to spin information
% excess is observed!! wow
% close to trheshold, pseudoscalar
% interpreted as ttbar bound state, first observation
% difficult to probe, difficult to model in QCD
% also: interpretation in terms of generic BSM pseudoscalars, scalars
% separately: interpretation as ALP - phenomenology study
